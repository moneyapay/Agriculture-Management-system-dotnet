        Sericulture, or silk farming, is the cultivation of silkworms to produce silk. Although there are several commercial
         species of silkworms, Bombyx mori (the caterpillar of the domesticated silk moth) is the most widely used and 
        intensively studied silkworm. Silk was first produced in China as early as the Neolithic period. Sericulture
         has become an important cottage industry in countries such as Brazil, China, France, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, 
        and Russia. Today, China and India are the two main producers, with more than 60% of the world's annual production.

    <p>
        According to Confucian text, the discovery of silk production dates to about 2700 BC, although archaeological records
         point to silk cultivation as early as the Yangshao period (5000 â€“ 3000 BC).[2] By about the first half of the 1st 
        century AD it had reached ancient Khotan,[3] by a series of interactions along the Silk Road. By 140 AD the practice had
         been established in India.[4] In the 6th century the smuggling of silkworm eggs into the Byzantine Empire led to its
         establishment in the Mediterranean, remaining a monopoly in the Byzantine Empire for centuries (Byzantine silk). 
        In 1147, during the Second Crusade, Roger II of Sicily (1095â€“1154) attacked Corinth and Thebes, two important centres 
        of Byzantine silk production, capturing the weavers and their equipment and establishing his own silkworks in Palermo 
        and Calabria,[5] eventually spreading the industry to Western Europe.

        Silkworm larvae are fed with mulberry leaves, and, after the fourth moult, climb a twig placed near them and spin their
         silken cocoons. This process is achieved by the worm through a dense fluid secreted from its structural glands, resulting
         in the fiber of the cocoon. The silk is a continuous filament comprising fibroin protein, secreted from two salivary
         glands in the head of each larva, and a gum called sericin, which cements the filaments.

    <p style="margin-top:200px;">
        The sericin is removed by placing the cocoons in hot water, which frees the silk filaments and readies them for reeling. 
        This is known as the degumming process.[6] The immersion in hot water also kills the silkworm pupae.
        Single filaments are combined to form thread, which is drawn under tension through several guides and wound onto reels.
        The threads may be plied to form yarn. After drying, the raw silk is packed according to quality.
