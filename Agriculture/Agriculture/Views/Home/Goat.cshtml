        Goat farming is the raising and breeding of domestic goats (Capra aegagrus hircus). It is a branch of animal husbandry. 
        Goats are raised principally for their meat, milk, fibre and skin. Goat farming can be very suited to production with other
         livestock such as sheep and cattle on low-quality grazing land. Goats efficiently convert sub-quality grazing matter that is 
        less desirable for other livestock into quality lean meat. Furthermore, goats can be farmed with a relatively small area of
        pasture and limited resources
